# gb-modding README

Adds a Gang Beasts Modding Tools tab, which allows you to easily create, build, and add references to projects.
This was made for the Gang Beasts Mod Loader made by me (dotpy).

Here's a tutorial on how to install it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ8TyoloMiE

## Extension Settings

Adds a setting so that the extension knows where you Gang Beasts folder is:

* `gangBeastsModding.gameDirectory`: Allows for projects to build direcly to your Mods folder.

## Known Issues

'bin' folder randomly appears. Just delete it.

**Enjoy!**
